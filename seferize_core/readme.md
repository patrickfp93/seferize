📦 SEFERIZE CORE

"The engine behind Seferize procedural macros." ⚙️

Seferize Core is a Rust library that powers the seferize procedural macro by parsing Rust items and generating their string representations. It supports attributes like #[ignore] and #[stringify], handles structs, enums, traits, impls, fields, variants, and methods, and is fully testable and safe, providing a reliable foundation for code introspection and compile-time code analysis.
